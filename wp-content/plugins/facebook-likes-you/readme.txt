Facebook Likes You! is simple plugin which makes it easy to add Facebook Like button and widgetable Like box.

== Description ==

Facebook Likes You! is simple plugin which makes it easy to add Facebook Like button and widgetable Facebook Like box. It's fully configurable, so you can decide where to append the button. Currently in the following languages:
* English
* Brazilian Portuguese (pt_BR)
* Czech (cs_CZ)
* Indonesian (id_ID)
* Italian (it_IT)
* Polish (pl_PL)
* Russian (ru_RU)

If you have created your own language pack, or have an update of an existing one, you can send [gettext .po and .mo files](http://codex.wordpress.org/Translating_WordPress) to me (my e-mail address is posted [here](http://www.sproject.name/o-mnie/)) so that I can bundle it into Facebook Likes You!

It's modified version of unsupported since 2011 [Facebook Likes it!](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/facebook-likes-it/).

== Installation ==

1. Upload folder named `facebook-likes-you` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I have IDN domain and it looks ugly when somebody likes my post. Insted of wi&#281;cek.pl there is xn--wicek-k0a.pl. Can you fix it? =

Unfortunately no. It is not a problem with plugin - it's with Facebook, because it doesn't support UTF in URL addresses like web browser does.

= I don't see the button. It doesn't work! =
Try to uncheck 'Use XFBML' checkbox or/and register your own app ID.

PayPal integration framework and admin interface as well as IPN listener.  Requires PHP5.

== Description ==

This plugins gives you a great framework to use for integrating with PayPal.
It stores both live and sandbox API credentials and allows you to switch back
and forth easily.  All NVP API calls are passed through the framework and
default values such as API version, API credentials, and even currency code are
added to the request based on settings from the admin panel.

It also has a built in IPN listener that validates messages as coming from
PayPal then throws WordPress actions based on messages received.  For example it
throws "paypal-recurring_payment_profile_cancel" when someone cancels a
recurring payment that they had set up with you.  It passes along all the info
that PayPal sent to the action, so it's simple to create other plugins that use
this one.

Requires PHP5.

= How do I send a request to PayPal? =

To send a request to PayPal, simply build the request as an associative array and pass it to the hashCall helper function like this:
<code>
$ppParams = array(
	'METHOD'			=> 'doDirectPayment',
	'PAYMENTACTION'		=> 'Sale',
	'IPADDRESS'			=> '123.123.123.123',
	'AMT'				=> '222.22',
	'DESC'				=> 'some product',
	'CREDITCARDTYPE'	=> 'VISA',
	'ACCT'				=> '4111111111111111',
	'EXPDATE'			=> '112011',

	'EMAIL'				=> 'pptest@xavisys.com',

	'STATE'				=> 'CA',
	'ZIP'				=> '92101',
